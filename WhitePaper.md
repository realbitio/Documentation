# Realbit
# A platform for assets tokenization and trading
## 1. Abstract
Realbit is a blockchain based assets backed tokenization and trading platform enabling global investors to invest in poor liquidity assets. The vision of Realbit is to build a global trading platform to increase assets efficiency by tokenizing the poor liquidity assets. We call it Realbit Exchange platform. On this platform, the assets include but not limited to large value of real estate such as office buildings, lands, hotels, shopping malls, gas stations, private homes, sharing workspaces, illiquid securities, and arts (hereafter called “assets” or “asset”).
For assets owners, they can get more liquidity by sharing a percentage of certain equity or operating income from the assets; and for investors, they can get lower investment barriers by investing in a fraction of large value assets.
This white paper explains the goal and vision of Realbit Platform, what are problems we address, and how we provide solutions. Also, we lay out a clear strategy of implementation roadmap to make it work in real world.
### Executive Summary
The value of real estate, non-tradeable equity, debts and arts totals USD 350 trillion. These assets make up more than half the value of worldwide assets. The major problems of these assets are lack of illiquidity, transparency and efficiency in transaction.
For owners, they own a large chunk of assets, while the values are stored in the assets with poor liquidity. Taking real estate as an example, the owners or developers can issue REITS, however, REITS only works for large owners or developers. A large number of medium or small owners don’t have access to such tools to increase liquidity of their assets in the needs of capitals.
For investors, large value assets investment barrier is high. Traditionally, only institutional or professional investors invest in large chunk of assets. While most of small investors with limited capital don’t have chances to invest in the assets due to the lack of securitized and liquidity assets.
To increase the liquidity of these assets, an asset tokenization and trading platform is needed to provide a tool for assets owners to increase the liquidity of the assets by tokenizing the assets in forms of a share of equity, future operating cash flow, or debts, etc; also to provide lower investment barriers for a large number of investors from all over the world to invest in a fraction of illiquidity assets.
Realbit team has a strong combination of experts coming from real estate, technology and financial sectors. They all have more than 10 years experience in senior management position in their field. Their expertise and knowledge with solid execution and learning ability will move Realbit platform forward.
## 2. Market Opportunities and Problems
### 2.1 Real Estate
Real estate is the largest class of assets in the world with a value of USD 217 trillion[1] , while only USD 16 trillion is traded with ~USD 100 billion transaction costs[2], which implies that only 7% of assets are traded with poor liquidity and low efficiency.
Below is a comparison of annualized returns between the S&P 500 Index and real estate. The annual return for the S&P 500 Index from 2001 to 2016 was 5%[3], while the annual return for real estate was 10.75%[4]. Real estate returns have doubled returns of the S&P 500 Index, which indicates real estate is more attractive for investment than S&P 500 Index[5].
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Annualized%20returns%20between%20real%20estate%20and%20S%26P%20500%20Index.png)
However, the major problem of real estate investment is its illiquidity comparing to other exchange-traded securities such as equities and bonds. Real estate is high entry and exit barrier market with long transaction time and high cost, thus this market is not as efficient as other markets. Also, cross-border investment in real estate is inefficient due to time and cost of currency exchange. The real estate value could appreciate if the real estate market could get more liquidity and efficiency.
### 2.2 Non-tradable equity and debts
The value of listed equity and debt is USD 270 trillion, while ~USD 130 trillion cannot be traded freely. For example, locked in shares offered to employees under incentive programs have a required vesting period. Typically, such shares must be held for several years before they can be exercised. Another example is that the founders, promoters, and other early supporters of the company are prohibited from selling or transferring shares during the IPO period. This period might last 90 days to several years from the time of IPO. As insiders, founders and other early shareholders can naturally be privy to information used about the company for an unfair advantage if they were permitted to trade those shares during an IPO. A locked in period mitigates the possibility of such manipulation by restricting their trades[6]. Most importantly, wide-scale selling of equity and debts will lead to a stock market crash and a sharp decline in price. This significantly decreases investors’ confidence. Those investors who believe the market is about to go down begin to sell their shares in an effort to avoid losing more money. The value of non-tradable equity and debts could be released, if non-tradable equity and debts could be used to create mortgage-backed asset tokens for trading.
### 2.3 Arts
The arts market is getting more attention and offers a new asset class to diversify investors' portfolios[7]. Study shows that its global value totals USD 3 trillion, and the return of arts as an asset class from 1972 to 2010 was ~6.5%[8]. However, only USD 0.1 trillion of arts is traded with ~USD 4 million transaction costs, and an auction of arts may achieve tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in sales[9]. This indicates arts investment costs a large amount of money and is very rare for small investors. Tokenization could be an efficient solution for arts investment problems solving, with increased trading efficiency and lowered barrier.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Annualized%20returns%20of%20arts%20.png)
Cash and gold are representatives of high liquidity assets. The total amount of money in the world is USD 83.6 trillion[8], while its trading volume is USD 1810.4 trillion, and the annual return from 2000 to 2017 was 2.55%[9]. The world's gold supply has an implied market cap of USD 6.3 trillion[10], while its trading volume is USD 22 trillion, and the annual return for gold from 2000 to 2017 was 5%[11]. Comparing to cash and gold, assets mentioned above have poor liquidity. But analysis indicates that they still get better returns on investments. In order to make more investors benefit from the illiquid assets, we need a solution to improve the liquidity of assets. The charts show how the Realbit platform aims to increase the liquidity of illiquidity assets, such as real estate, non- tradable equity, debts and arts.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Current%20liquidity%20and%20return%20%26%20Expected%20liquidity%20and%20return.png)
The emerge of blockchain technology provides the chance to solve these problems. Assets owners can gain higher liquidity and unlock the value of their assets. Taking real estate as an example, blockchain technology not only reduces the cost of property sales, but also makes it possible to invest in a fraction of real estate in different kinds of forms including equity shared ownership, debt ownership, and operation income ownership, etc. The real estate owners also can set up different exit strategies such as buy back, short term ownership transfer, long term ownership transfer, debt payback, and other exit strategies. This will be a revolutionary idea after blockchain technology is applied to illiquid assets investments.
## 3. RealbitPlatformSolutions
### 3.1 Overview
Blockchian is a type of shared database, the contents of which are verified and agreed upon by all the independent nodes on the network. If the transaction information is accepted by all nodes, it will be recorded in the distributed ledger. Because each new set of transactions called block is cryptographically linked to the previous block, it is extraordinarily difficult to tamper data stored in a blockchain and any such change attempt will be detectable. Thus, blockchains are widely considered to be immutable and can serve as a record of proof of ownership.
The solutions proposed by Realbit platform is to create an ecosystem to realize assets-backed tokenization and improve the trading efficiency. The ecosystem is an application consisting of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) based on blockchain. DAOs leverage the power of blockchain, using smart contracts to regulate the conduct and relationships among different entities, specifying responsibilities, payments, etc. Realbit prototype is designed preliminarily as shown in the chart below.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Realbit%20solutions.png)
Realbit platform seeks to improve the liquidity of assets and enhance the security of transactions while reducing inefficiencies through innovative blockchain technology, by linking listing initiators, investors and third parties around the world. On Realbit platform, various assets can be listed. The listing information will be verified and recorded in blockchain’s distributed ledgers. Transactions will be triggered automatically by clauses set in various smart contracts and are trackable and irreversible. Successfully sold tokens can be traded freely in Realbit Exchange platform. Third parties will also be attracted to provide services online or offline.
Realbit ecosystem consists of Two-Layer-Token: one layer is utility tokens issued by Realbit Platform, another layer is asset tokens issued by listing initiators. Utility tokens named RAB are applied to circulate in Realbit ecosystem. Asset tokens can only circulate in Realbit ecosystem. The Two-Layer- Token design not only promotes the development of platform ecosystem, but also provides a quarantine mechanism to stabilize asset tokens. To incentivize the development of Realbit ecosystem, all the participants contributed to Realbit ecosystem will be rewarded with RAB tokens. And RAB also can be consumed to perform transactions.
### 3.2 Listing mechanism
The solutions we proposed start with listing assets including but not limited to high-value real estate, such as office buildings, lands, hotels, shopping malls, gas stations, apartments, private homes, sharing workspace and arts, illiquidity securities, etc. Taking real estate as an example to explain the mechanism, listing mechanism consists of Title Registry and Tokenization, which enables the listing initiators to tokenize their assets. To motivate assets owners to list their assets, it is free of charge to list assets in the beginning. With the development of Realbit platform, listing initiators will be charged a relatively low service fee to list. Below prototype shows the specific listing mechanism on Realbit platform.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Listing%20mechanism.png)
### 3.2.1 Title Registry
Realbit enables assets initiators verified by KYC (Know Your Customer) system to list their assets on the platform. There are different title registry systems for assets rights and transfer processes in different countries. It is very hard to convince all the governments to use one unified title registry system. Thus, the documents become difficult to be verified especially for cross-border transaction.
To solve these problems, third party title offices will be involved. They can accept and verify the title information/data from current official land or property registry submitted by listing initiators. In the case of cross-border transaction, Realbit platform introduces third party notary offices to notarize the title documents. Ultimately, the title information/data recorded in official ledger would be registered in the Realbit distributed blockchain ledger. In order to make it a global title information ledger, Realbit will actively engage with different governments to accelerate the acceptance of Realbit distributed blockchain ledger as a legally valid ledger of records for real estate transfers.
### 3.2.2 Tokenization
After title registry, Realbit tokenization smart contact will enable the listing initiators to tokenize their assets. Realbit platform provides various schemes such as sales as whole, equity split sales, debt split sales, leasing, operation income sharing, etc, and also provides various exit strategies such as buying back, short term title transfer, long term title transfer, dividend, rental, etc.  
To realize assets tokenization, Realbit platform enables listing initiators to issue asset tokens. The listed assets can be tokenized by certain number of shares based on the unit area such as per square meters, centimeters, millimeters, depending on how large the asset is and what liquidity level the initiators want this asset to be, the price of per unit area will be linked to the real value of the asset upon listed, or linked to the debt value, cash flow discounted value per unit area. Eventually, tokens issued by different listing initiators will constitute a Token pool, those tokens represent different investment proposals with different returns depending on the asset type, revenue models, etc.
Clauses such as the schemes set by listing initiators will be incorporated into Realbit tokenization smart contact. If the necessary terms are satisfied, then the contractual clauses may be made partially or fully self-executing.
### 3.3 Underwriting mechanism
Underwriting is a necessary process for listing initiators to raise capital from investors before trading asset tokens in Realbit exchange. It has two primary functions: 1) It helps listing initiators fully understand the market conditions of listed assets, set initial price more reasonably, and finally sell the asset tokens successfully. and 2) It helps investors better evaluate the listing initiators and the listed assets, thus make more reasonable investment decisions of the asset tokens. In addition, third-parties will be involved to provide services to complete the underwriting process.
In Realbit ecosystem, underwriting process is composed of rating, initial pricing, bidding, opening price calculating, book keeping, SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) setting up, digital deed signing, title transferring, etc. Its workflow is illustrated as below.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Underwriting%20mechanism.png)
### 3.3.1 Rating
Asset tokens issued by different listing initiators constitute a token pool. The risks and returns vary widely among those asset tokens. To help investors better assess the asset tokens and make more reasonable and wiser decisions of investing in asset tokens, token rating firms will be involved.
The rating process is similar to Moody's Ratings. A rating mechanism is provided to measure relative investment value of the asset tokens. Rating firms provide rating reports on various asset tokens. Listing initiators can also apply for rating services. The rating reports from different rating firms will be public to all Realbit users.
### 3.3.2 Initial Pricing
A reasonable initial price is crucial in bidding process. If the price is set above the real value, the asset token sales might fail. If the price is set below the real value, the token sales might be over booked. The token price of each listed assets only can be affected by the operation or value change of assets themselves. The fluctuation of price is affected by interest rate, economics, and trading itself, etc. To help listing initiators better understand the market and set the initial price more reasonable, third parties such as accounting firms will be involved to provide price offering advice service.
Price advice providers analyze, evaluate the asset by taking factors into consideration such as asset type, revenue model, etc, and produce an initial price offering advice report. The suggested initial price is determined in local fiat currency. Listing initiators can consider suggested initial price, and set the clauses in underwriting smart contract, such as initial price and minimum number of tokens purchased.
### 3.3.3 Bidding & Opening Price
To determine the opening price of asset tokens, Realbit involves a bidding process. Bidding can also tell the listing initiator how market reacts on the initial price.
Investors verified by KYC system have the opportunity to participate in bidding. They can set the bidding price and quantity of the asset tokens they are willing to purchase. Once the investors bid, the corresponding token funds will be transferred to an escrow account automatically, and the token funds will be kept in the escrow account until the bidding process ends. Each investor’s bidding price, bidding quantity, and token funds transferring records will be recorded in the distributed ledger.
At the end of bidding, the opening price will be calculated based on the bidding price and quantity offered by all investors in bidding system. This may lead to the following two results:
1) Token sales succeeded: When the pre-programmed conditions are triggered, underwriting
smart contract executes the corresponding contractual clause. According to the principle of price priority and time priority, all the winning bidders can buy each asset token at the opening price. If the tokens are over booked, then the token funds corresponding to the over booked shares will be returned to each investor’s wallet proportionally.
2) Token sales failed: Clauses set in underwriting smart contract cannot be triggered. This may be due to irrational initial price, quantity limitations, bad market environment, etc. When token sales failed, the token funds transferred to escrow account in bidding process will be returned to each investor’s wallet automatically.
### 3.3.4 Book keeping & SPV
In case of token sales succeeded, each transaction will be recorded in a book keeping distributed ledger. To ensure that token investors own the asset, SPV is needed to hold the asset, and is necessary step for trading. In case that no SPV is needed for certain type of assets, assets can be mortgaged and hold in an escrow agency.
Asset token investors will be invited to vote and select a registry service provider to help them set up an SPV. When the offline registration is completed, investors will have the shares of SPV. SPV will have the ownership of the asset legally after digital transfer contract signed by listing initiator and investors.
### 3.3.5 Digital transfer contract sign & Title transfer completed
When SPV registration is completed, the listing initiator and investors can sign digital agreements on Realbit platform:
1) Realbit platform generates the title transfer contract for listing initiator and investors.
2) Listing initiator accepts and signs the title transfer contract.
3) Investors accept and sign the title transfer contract.
4) Registry service provider helps to complete the offline title transfer.
5) Token funds will be transferred from the escrow account to the listing initiator’s wallet.
6) All the title transferring information and trading data are recorded on the blockchain.
Eventually, the ownership transferring is completed and SPV has the ownership of the asset legally.
## 3.4 Trading
When underwriting process is completed, asset tokens can be traded on Realbit exchange platform. Worldwide investors can easily search and check the asset tokens through user friendly interface. Those investors verified by KYC system can trade asset tokens on Realbit exchange platform with relatively low transaction fees than previously. This is similar to purchasing stocks on a stock exchange. To elaborate the trading mechanism among worldwide investors on Realbit exchange platform, the chart below shows the scenario and how blockchain makes it easier.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Trading%20on%20Realbit%20exchange.png)
Tokens or fiat currency can be accepted for investments on Realbit platform. Tokens include RAB tokens, asset tokens, cryptocurrency (e.g. BTC, ETH...) and there will be an exchange rate among various tokens. Fiat currency can only be accepted in the OTC market (Over-the-Counter Market) on Realbit platform.
In the process of transaction, Realbit platform will involve a mechanism to dynamically calculate the real-time price of each token according to the current bidding price, number of shares, market environment, etc. When the bidding price set by investors is accepted, the tokens or fiat currency will be transferred to the seller’s account and the investors acquire the asset tokens. All the transactions and data are open to users on corresponding side chains to guarantee the transparency of the system.
## 4 Realbit technology framework and features
In terms of technology, we trust that blockchain is one of the most secure technologies for digital asset transfer due to its distributed nature and use of sophisticated cryptography. Smart contracts, therefore, offer a potential solution for the management of poor liquidity assets transactions via the distributed ledger. At the same time, tokenization creates benefits for investors and token holders, thereby aligning user incentives for further growth of the entire network.
Realbit consists of multiple core components in architecture, the following sections offer more detailed descriptions of our key components and core algorithm.
### 4.1 Logical Framework
Realbit has designed an ecosystem powered by blockchain, smart contracts, incentive mechanism, combining the assets, inspector, legal, escrow, payments industries, etc.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/State-of-our%20framework.png)
### 4.2 IPFS storage
We expect a blockchain-based mechanism powerful enough to store terabytes of asset-related files, to run many high performance operations such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of documents, which are frequently operated on the Realbit ecosystem.
To encrypt and store digital content onto the blockchain, most blockchain-based storage systems use an encoded ID to reference centrally-hosted data, but the limited storage makes it hard to store extensive strings of metadata onto the blockchain per transaction. If blockchain and data expands, it leads to insufficient hash power. The larger is the distributed ledger, the more hash power is needed to maintain the data. So there are technological disadvantages in encoding metadata onto the blockchain.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Custom-built%20distributed%20ledger.png)
Realbit has started a metadata protocol based on blockchain technology that uses the IPFS (Interplanetary File System), which eliminates the limitations of existing solutions by using the IPFS to store the data, recording the data onto the blockchain to authenticate the information with the hash of file content. To store file body, Realbit supplies distributed storage with which method the cost of storage space and bandwidth will be extremely reduced compared to the decentralized way. This enables assets trading participators to encrypt to their files such as title deed, digital signature and all the other related documents by making information and documents interoperable and discoverable through a decentralized hybrid system[11].
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Metadata%20protocol%20stack.png)
Rich relations between objects can be expressed with Merkle DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in object content, allowing the application layer to evolve. Realbit uses a coordination layer to discover, merge, and connect multiple DAGs generated by independent individuals into a single, collaborative DAG[12].
In P2P networks, Merkle Tree is used to ensure that data blocks received from other nodes are not corrupted and not replaced, and even check that other nodes do not cheat or publish bogus blocks.
To understand how Merkle DAGs[13] address content, see the chart below.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Address%20content%20based%20on%20Merkle%20DAGs.png)
The familiar BT download is using P2P technology to enable data transfer between clients, which can speed up the download speed of data and reduce the burden of downloading servers. Before downloading a file on a p2p network, in most cases the top hash is acquired from a trusted source, for instance a friend or a web site that is known to have good recommendations of files to download. When the top hash is available, the hash tree can be received from any non-trusted source, like any peer in the p2p network. Then, the received hash tree is checked against the trusted top hash, and if the hash tree is damaged or fake, another hash tree from another source will be tried until the program finds one that matches the top hash[14].
### 4.3 Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)
Realbit is designed to put safety, stability and high-performance in the first place in order to create the ecosystem mentioned above.
In cryptocurrency technology, the consensus algorithm is used to ensure the whole blockchain network safe and stable. The famous consensus algorithms include the Bitcoin using PoW (Proof of Work, at 7 TPS in average) and Ethereum using PoS (Proof of Stake, at 30 TPS in average). However, none of these consensus algorithms can solve the transaction performance problem, especially the PoW algorithm, which consumes a large amount of power required to calculate. DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) has solved the problem of performance and energy consumption well and has proven robust, secure, and efficient by years of reliable operation on multiple blockchains[15].
Under this algorithm, those who hold tokens on a blockchain may select block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may be chosen to participate in block production and exactly one producer is authorized to produce a block at any given point in time.
At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. The selected producers are shuffled using a pseudorandom number derived from the block time. This shuffling is done to ensure that all producers maintain balanced connectivity to all other producers.
If the block is not produced at the scheduled time then the block for that time slot is skipped. If a producer misses a block and has not produced any block within the last 24 hours they are removed from consideration until they notify the blockchain of their intention to start producing blocks again.
This ensures the network operates smoothly by minimizing the number of blocks missed by not scheduling those who are proven to be unreliable.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/DPOS%20mechanism.png)
Typical DPoS blockchains have 100% block producer participation. A transaction can be considered confirmed with 99.9% certainty after an average of 1.5 seconds from time of broadcast.
The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees.
### 4.4 Atomic swaps
Atomic swaps, or atomic cross-chain trading is a distributed coordination task where multiple parties exchange assets across multiple blockchains, for example, trading BTC for RAB, instead of on a centralized exchange, i.e. To prevent one side falling to send over his token, atomic swaps utilizes what is known as hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs). HTLCs ensure that the atomic swap process is completely trustless by ensuring both fulfill the requirements of the trade. HTLCs require the recipient of a payment to acknowledge receiving payment prior to a deadline by generating a cryptographic proof of payment[16]. Or the recipient risks losing the right to the claim the payment, therefore returning the funds back to the sender. This results in both transactions being linked to one another, despite them taking place across two different blockchains[17].
An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol.
A cross-chain swap has an associated directed graph D=(V,A). For any pair (D,L), where D=(V,A) is a strongly-connected directed graph and L⊂V a feedback vertex set for D, we give an atomic cross- chain swap protocol using hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in L generate the hashlocked secrets.
### 4.5 Security
Blockchain relies on encryption to validate transactions by verifying the identities of parties involved in a transaction. This ensures that a faulty transaction cannot be added to the blockchain without the consent of the parties involved. A complex mathematical calculation known as a hashis performed each time a transaction is added to the blockchain, which depends on the transaction data, the identities of the parties involved in the transaction, and the result of previous transactions. The fact that the current state of the blockchain depends on previous transactions ensures that a malicious actor cannot alter past transactions. This is because if previous transaction data is changed, it will impact the current value of the hash and not match other copies of the ledger.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Data%20structure%20of%20blockchain.png)
On the Realbit platform, we encrypt a key pair, using which we make transactions. A key pair consists of a private key associated with the owner's address and a unique public key produced by the private key. The public key is to receive the token, and the private key is to produce cryptographic signature in the transactions.
All submissions can be verified by the public key and signature submitted, and confirm whether the transaction is valid or not, that is, confirming that the payer has the right of ownership of the transaction at this time. The processes are secured by an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) on the curve secp256k1.
### 4.6 Scalability
REALBIT is expected to support Baas (Blockchain as a service) API which provides inspector service, transaction service, data service to enable easy access to Realbit data for third-party applications. An API libraries is being developed.
### 4.7 Smart Contract
Realbit architecture consists of multiple contracts, each contract is responsible for a single type of microservices and each contract contains functions that the creation and modification of data.
The following participants need to be involved in smart contracts
• Buyer/Investor/Token holder
• Seller (Property owner/Real estate developer/Land owner/Operator)
• Notary or Government validator
• Assessment firm
• Real Inspector
• Law firm
• Escrow
• Recording office/Title registry
• Others
Listing smart contract is responsible for recording assets metadata on the blockchain; and RABs will be sent to Inspectors (i.e. real inspector, title registry, recording office) as reward.
Tokenization smart contract is responsible for setting schemes (such as sales as whole, equity split sales, debt split sales, leasing, operation income sharing, etc) and covenant clauses (such as buying back, short term title transfer, long term title transfer, dividend, rental, etc).
Underwriting smart contract is responsible for rating, setting initial price, bidding, calculating opening price, book keeping, SPV setting up, digital deed signing, title transferring, etc.
### 4.8 Enabling by AI and big data
AI and big data is expected in Realbit platform, with which help, assets rating can be more reasonable and efficient and risk can be minimize. Anti-fraud and modeling algorithms are provided on the Realbit blockchain through deep learning and AI risk control systems.
Through Facial recognition technology, Owner provides compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) policies of Realbit.
Enabling by AI and big data is under development.
## 5 ProductPrototype
In the future, Realbit aims to build the ecosystem realizing assets-backed tokenization and improving the trading efficiency. On the platform, asset tokens can be managed, exchanged, and stored.
### 5.1 Asset browser page
Asset listed on Realbit platform can be displayed on asset browser page. On this page, investors can view detailed asset information. Bidding, purchasing, or selling function will also be provided depending on different stages of asset tokens. The following prototype shows the asset browser page.
### 5.2 Realbit exchange platform
Successfully sold tokens in underwriting process will be displayed and traded in Realbit exchange platform. Realbit exchange provides a variety of functions, such as search, display, purchase and sell asset tokens. The exchange trading prototype is designed as follows:
### 5.3 Realbit wallet
The mobile app and the desktop application will be developed, and they will have a digital wallet to store tokens. With the help of Realbit wallet, users can conveniently manage their asset tokens and RAB token in one place. Signing all of the transactions to guarantee the security of trading. The transaction records are recorded on the ledger of Realbit. Below is the prototype of wallet.
## 6 Platform token(RAB)
Realbit is an autonomous community bounds together with economic incentives. The RAB token is utility token. It functions as the medium of exchange and can be consumed within the Realbit network to incentivize all participants to contribute to the success of the community. It can be used to support various scenarios and do the following:
• Reward for community contributors
The community will attract a variety of participants, such as developers. They will help to build the basic infrastructure and promote the improvement of community. In return, they will be rewarded RAB.
• Incentive for participants
In order to promote the rapid development and prosperity of Realbit ecosystem, Realbit encourages participants such as listing initiators, third party service providers to use the platform. In the beginning, Realbit platform will provide RAB as reward.
• Payment for third party service fees
In Realbit ecosystem, third parties (title office, escrow agent, law firms, broker, accounting firms, rating/assessment firms, etc.) will be attracted to provide services. Asset listing initiators or investors should pay for the corresponding fees.
• Payment for transaction fees
Investors invest in various asset tokens on Realbit exchange platform should pay for transaction fees. Transaction fees are determined by the market.
• Purchase of asset tokens or assets on Realbit platform
Investors can buy various asset tokens or assets with RAB on Realbit platform. There will be an exchange between RAB and other asset tokens.
The above scenarios can be summarized in the following diagram:
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/RAB%20earning%20and%20spending.png)
With the participation of more Realbit users and the development of community, the ecosystem will grow more prosperous. Thus, the liquidity of RAB will be increased.
## 7 Governance
In addition to payment or investment function, the RAB token plays an important role in the governance of Realbit ecosystem. The RAB holders have decentralized governance over the protocols, allowing for voting to decide some agreements.
The voting mechanism is important for the long-term stability of Realbit system. For example, RAB relies on a set of system parameters to function. While some of the parameters can be adjusted automatically, others need opinions from the community with voting. Fixing bugs, proposing and deploying new DApp also need support from community.
Realbit supports liquid voting. Every RAB owner, weighted by their RAB capacity, can participate in the decision-making process of Realbit’s development. In liquid voting, users can set their own delegates, and delegates can also set their own delegates. Taking into account a proposal’s technicality and incentives, different proposals can have different acceptance criteria, such as participation rate and support ratio.
Note that RAB’s liquid voting is a tool to express community consensus, not one to form consensus. Before the votes, the community should use various communication channels to study the proposals in detail and form rough consensus.
## 8 Roadmap
In the past four years, we have been dedicated to researching the development of real estate market. We find real estate is the largest class of assets and the main problem is illiquidity. The emerge of blockchain technology provides the possibility to improve liquidity. We have an ambitious execution plan and roadmap that started in 2017 Q4. We share with you this glimpse of our plans and we believe we are at the right time. However, with implementing change, the roadmap can be adjusted as needed.
