# Realbit
# A platform for assets tokenization and trading
## 1. Abstract
Realbit is a blockchain based asset backed tokenization and trading platform enabling global investors to invest in illiquid assets. Realbit’s vision is to build a global trading platform for illiquid assets by using a blockchain and tokenization. We are calling it the Realbit Exchange Platform. On this platform, these assets may include, but are not limited to, various real estate (e.g. office buildings, lands, hotels, shopping malls, gas stations, private homes, sharing workspaces), illiquid securities, art and other non-fungible assets (hereafter referred to as “asset(s)”).
For asset providers, they can increase their liquidity by sharing a percentage, or all, of certain equity or operating income from the assets with flexibility in the offering details. For investors, they will benefit from lower investment barriers and better diversification by investing in fractional ownership in high value assets they would normally be excluded from investing in. Investors will even be able to create their own personal synthetic REIT portfolio. Both counterparties benefit from better price discovery and transaction speeds.
This white paper explains the goal and vision of the Realbit Exchange Platform, what problems we address, and how we provide solutions. Also, we lay out a clear implementation roadmap to execute our vision.
### Executive Summary
The global value of real estate, non-tradeable equity, debt and art totals US$ 350 trillion. These assets make up more than half of worldwide asset value. The major problems with these assets are lack of illiquidity, transparency and efficiency in transaction.
For asset owners, they own large non-fungible assets that rarely trade and take a considerable amount of time, effort and money if they do. With real estate, for example, owners or developers can issue REITs. However, REITs typically only work for large property owners or developers. Most small and medium owners don’t have access to such tools to manage their asset and capital needs.
For smaller investors, the investment barrier for high value assets is out of reach. Exchange traded REITs reach a larger investor group but are inflexible. Traditionally, only institutional or professional investors are invited to provide capital to development projects while smaller investors with limited capital have to sit on the sidelines.
To start solving some of these long standing problems, an asset tokenization and trading platform will be created to provide tools for assets owners better asset liquidity by tokenizing the assets in forms of a share of equity, future operating cash flow, or debts, etc. Simultaneously, tokenization provides lower investment barriers and more asset choices for many investors from all over the world to invest in.
The Realbit Exchange Platform has a strong team of real estate, technology and financial experts with a mix of corporate and start-up backgrounds. Collectively, the management team has 60 years of experience. Their expertise, knowledge, passion and ability to execute will keep the Realbit platform moving forward, innovating and improving.
## 2. Market Opportunities and Problems
### 2.1 Real Estate
Real estate is the largest asset class in the world totaling US$ 217 trillion<sup>[1]</sup>, , while only US$ 16 trillion is traded, which implies only 7% of the market is traded at all<sup>[2]</sup>.Statistics show real estate is a high-cost market. The cost of transaction fees, commission of listing agent and tax of selling real estate may up to~30% of the price<sup>[3]</sup>.
Below is a comparison of annualized returns between the S&P 500 Index and real estate. The annual return for the S&P 500 Index from 2001 to 2016 was 5%, while the annual return for real estate was 10.75%<sup>[4]</sup>. In that time period, real estate returns have doubled returns of the S&P 500 Index, showing that in this time period real estate has been a more attractive investment than the S&P 500 Index<sup>[5]</sup>.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Annualized%20returns%20between%20real%20estate%20and%20S%26P%20500%20Index.png)
However, the major problem of real estate investment is its illiquidity comparing to other exchange-traded securities such as equities and bonds. Real estate is high entry and exit barrier market with long transaction time and high cost, thus this market is not as efficient as other markets. Also, cross-border investment in real estate is inefficient due to time and cost of currency exchange. The real estate value could appreciate if the real estate market could get more liquidity and efficiency.
### 2.2 Non-tradable equity and debts
The value of listed equity and debt is US$ 270 trillion, while ~US$ 130 trillion cannot be traded freely. For example, locked in shares offered to employees under incentive programs have a required vesting period. Typically, such shares must be held for several years before they can be exercised. Another example is that the founders, promoters, and other early supporters of the company are prohibited from selling or transferring shares during the IPO period. This period might last 180 days to several years from the time of IPO. As insiders, founders and other early shareholders can naturally be privy to information used about the company for an unfair advantage if they were permitted to trade those shares during an IPO. A locked in period mitigates the possibility of such manipulation by restricting their trades. Most importantly, even if some equity and debt are not restricted from trading, the owners won’t trade freely. Because wide-scale selling of equity and debts will lead to a stock market crash and a sharp decline in price. This significantly decreases investors’ confidence. Those investors who believe the market is about to go down begin to sell their shares to avoid losing money. If non-tradable equity and debts can be tokenized, its liquidity can be increased with minimum effect on stock itself.
### 2.3 Arts
The art market is getting more attention and offers a new asset class to diversify investors' portfolios. Study shows that its global value totals US$ 3 trillion, the return of art as an asset class from 1972 to 2010 was ~6.5%[6] and the annualized log sale-to-sale returns of art can be reflected in the following chart. However, only US$ 0.1 trillion of arts is traded and the transaction cost is up to 17.5% for a buyer[7]. Typically an auction of arts may achieve tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in sales [8]. These indicate art investment costs a large amount of money and is very rare for small investors. As with real estate, tokenization could be an efficient solution for art investment, with increased trading efficiency and more opportunities for investors.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Annualized%20returns%20of%20arts%20.png)
Cash and gold are highly liquid assets. The total amount of money in the world is US$ 83.6 trillion [9], while its trading volume is US$ 1,810.4 trillion, and the annual return from 2000 to 2017 was 2.55% [10]. The world's gold supply has an implied market cap of US$ 6.3 trillion [11], while its trading volume is US$ 22 trillion, and the annual return for gold from 2000 to 2017 was 5% [12]. Comparing to cash and gold, assets mentioned above have poor liquidity. But analysis indicates that they still get better returns on investments. In order to make more investors benefit from the illiquid assets, we need a solution to improve the liquidity of assets. The charts show how the Realbit platform aims to increase the liquidity of illiquid assets, such as real estate, non-tradable equity, debts and arts.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Current%20liquidity%20and%20return%20%26%20Expected%20liquidity%20and%20return.png)
The emergence of blockchain technology provides the chance to solve these problems. Asset owners benefit from better liquidity to unlock the value of their assets and manage their capital needs more precisely. For example, blockchain technology not only reduces the cost of property sales, but also makes it possible to invest in a fraction of real estate in different forms including equity shared ownership, debt ownership, and operation income ownership. The real estate owners also can set up different covenant clauses such as buy back, short term ownership transfer, long term ownership transfer, debt payback, and other covenant clauses. This seemingly simple idea will have revolutionary influence after blockchain technology is applied to illiquid asset markets.
## 3. RealbitPlatformSolutions
### 3.1 Overview
A blockchain is a type of distributed database, the contents of which are verified and agreed upon by all the independent nodes on the network. If the transaction information is accepted by all nodes, it will be recorded in the distributed ledger. Because each new set of transactions, called a block, is cryptographically linked to the previous block, it is extraordinarily difficult to tamper or change data that is stored in a blockchain and any such change attempt will be detectable. Thus, blockchains are widely considered to be immutable and can serve as a record for proof of ownership of various digital and real assets.
The solutions proposed by the Realbit platform is to create an ecosystem to realize asset-backed tokenization and improve the trading efficiency. The ecosystem is an application consisting of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) based on EOS blockchain software. DAOs leverage the power of blockchain tech, using smart contracts to regulate the conduct and relationships among different entities, specifying responsibilities, payments, etc. This has also been called programmable money. The Realbit prototype is designed preliminarily as shown in the chart below:
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Realbit%20solutions.png)
The Realbit platform seeks to improve the liquidity of assets and enhance the security of transactions while reducing inefficiencies through innovative blockchain technology, by linking listing initiators, investors and third parties around the world. The listing information will be verified and recorded on the platform’s distributed ledgers. Transactions will be triggered automatically by clauses set in various smart contracts and are trackable and irreversible. Successfully sold tokens can be traded freely in Realbit Exchange platform. Contributors to the platform will also be attracted to provide services online or offline through token rewards.
The Realbit ecosystem consists of Two-Layer-Token: one layer is utility tokens issued by Realbit Platform, another layer is asset backed tokens issued by listing initiators. Utility tokens named RAB circulate in the Realbit ecosystem and to incentivize the development of the ecosystem to pay for transaction fees, monetary transfers, asset tokens, 3rd party services and as rewards for various types of contributors. RAB offers no equity stake, income or profit sharing characteristics. Asset tokens will only circulate in Realbit ecosystem. The Two-Layer-Token design not only promotes the development of platform ecosystem, but also provides a quarantine mechanism to stabilize asset tokens and focus investment exposure on the assets rather than the tokens.
### 3.2 Listing mechanism
The solutions we propose start with listing assets including but not limited to high-value real estate, such as office & commercial, hotels, retail, residential, healthcare, agriculture, sharing workspace, specialty property, art, illiquid securities, etc. Using real estate as an illustrative example, the listing mechanism consists of Title Registry and Tokenization, which enables the listing initiators to tokenize their assets. To motivate assets owners to list their assets, there will be an initial period of zero transactions fees for asset tokenization. After this initial period, with further market acceptance of the Realbit platform, listing initiators will be charged a relatively low service fee priced in RAB token to process listings. Below is the prototype that shows the specific listing mechanism on the Realbit platform.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Listing%20mechanism.png)
### 3.2.1 Title Registry
Realbit enables assets initiators verified by a KYC (Know Your Customer) system to list their assets on the platform. Title registry systems for assets rights and transfer processes can vary significantly in different countries. The likelihood of being able to convince all, or even some, governments to use one unified title registry system is highly unlikely. Thus, the documents verification can be burdensome especially for cross-border transactions.
To solve this problem, third party title offices will be a key part of the initial platform structure. They will accept and verify the title information/data from current official land or property registries submitted by listing initiators. In the case of cross-border transaction, Realbit platform introduces third party notary offices to notarize the title documents. Ultimately, the title information and data recorded in official ledger is registered in the Realbit distributed blockchain ledger. In order to make it a global title information ledger, Realbit will actively engage with different governments to accelerate the acceptance of Realbit distributed blockchain ledger as a legally valid ledger of records for real estate registrations and transfers.
### 3.2.2 Tokenization
After title registry, a Realbit tokenization smart contact will enable the listing initiators to tokenize their assets. During the asset tokenization process, asset initiators will be able to monetize their assets using various parameters. These may be more or less favorable to the asset initiator and thus be reflected in the market price for the tokens. Realbit platform provides various monetization structuring choices such as whole property sale, equity split sales, debt and debt split sales, leasing, operation income sharing, etc, and also provides various covenant clauses such as buy back, short term title transfer, long term title transfer, dividend, rental, etc.
The listed assets can be represented by an amount of tokens based on the unit area such as per square meter, centimeter, or millimeter, depending on how large the asset is and what the desired level of liquidity the initiators want. Assets backed by too few tokens will suffer from lower liquidity and market trading. The price per token will be linked to the real value of the asset when it is listed, or linked to the debt value, cash flow discounted value per unit area according the arrangement chosen by the asset initiator. Eventually, tokens issued by different listing initiators will constitute a diversified token pool, those tokens representing different investment proposals with different returns depending on the asset type, revenue models, and other structural parameters.
Sales parameters set by listing initiators will be incorporated into the Realbit tokenization smart contacts and asset specific tokens. If the necessary contract triggers are satisfied, then the contractual clauses may be made partially or fully self-executing.
### 3.3 Underwriting mechanism
Underwriting is a necessary process for listing initiators to raise capital from investors before trading asset tokens in Realbit exchange. It has two primary functions: 1) Helps listing initiators fully understand the market conditions for their assets, engage in price discovery, and finally to have a successful asset tokens sale. 2) Helps investors better evaluate the listing initiators and the listed assets, and so make better investment decisions about the investment fit of the asset tokens. In addition, third- parties will be involved to provide services to complete the underwriting process.
The underwriting process is composed of rating, initial pricing, bidding, opening price calculating, book keeping, establishing SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle), digital deed signing, auditing, and title transferring.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Underwriting%20mechanism.png)
### 3.3.1 Rating
Asset tokens issued by different listing initiators constitute the platform’s total token pool. The risks and returns profiles will vary widely among those asset tokens. To help investors better assess the asset tokens and make wise and prudent investing decisions, token rating firms will be involved.
The rating process is similar to Moody's Ratings. A rating mechanism is provided to measure relative investment value of the asset tokens. Rating firms provide rating reports on various asset tokens. Listing initiators can also apply for rating services. The rating reports from different rating firms will be public to all Realbit users, who can review and provide comments.
### 3.3.2 Initial Pricing
A reasonable initial price is crucial for both sides of the bidding process. If the price is set above the market value, the asset token sales event has a high probability of failure. If the price is set below the market value, the token sales will be over booked and the asset initiator may not extract the asset’s full value. The token price of each listed asset only can be affected by the operation or value change of assets themselves. The fluctuation of price is affected by interest rate, economics, and trading itself. To help listing initiators better understand the market and set the initial price more reasonable, third parties such as accounting firms or realty firms will be involved to provide pricing guidance.
Price advisors evaluate the asset by taking factors into consideration such as asset type, revenue model, yield, and property location to produce an initial price offering advice report denominated in local fiat currency. Listing initiators are provided with the suggested initial price, and then determine the rest of the offering parameters for the underwriting smart contract, such as initial price, type of sale, conditions and minimum number of tokens purchased. In order to provide improved liquidity for all investors, Realbit will establish basic guidelines for all offerings.
### 3.3.3 Bidding & Opening Price
Realbit will conduct a bidding process to determine the asset token’s opening price. Bidding can also tell the listing initiator how market reacts on the initial price.
Investors verified by the KYC system have the opportunity to participate in the bidding. They can set the bidding price and quantity of the asset tokens they are willing to purchase. Once the investors bid, the corresponding token funds will be transferred to an escrow account automatically, and the token funds will be kept in the escrow account until the bidding process ends. Each investor’s bidding price, bidding quantity, and token transfer records will be recorded in the distributed ledger.
At the end of bidding, the opening price will be calculated based on the bidding price and quantity offered by all investors in the bidding process. The process ends in either success or failure:
1) Success: When the pre-programmed conditions are triggered, underwriting smart contract executes the corresponding contractual clauses. According to the principle of price priority and time priority, all the winning bidders can buy each asset token at the opening price. If the tokens are over booked, then the token funds corresponding to the over booked shares will be returned to each investor’s wallet proportionally.
2) Failure: Clauses set in underwriting smart contract cannot be triggered. This may be due to high initial price, quantity issues, bad market environment, deal terms, or simple lack of interest. When token sales fail, the token funds transferred to escrow account during the bidding process will be returned to each investor’s wallet automatically.
### 3.3.4 Book keeping & SPV
When token sales succeed, each transaction will be recorded in a book keeping distributed ledger. To ensure that token investors own the asset, SPV is needed to hold the asset, and is necessary step for trading. In case that no SPV is needed for certain types of assets, assets can be mortgaged and hold in an escrow agency.
Asset token investors will be invited to vote and select a SPV registry service provider to help them set up an SPV. When the offline registration is completed, investors will have the shares of SPV.
### 3.3.5 Digital transfer contract sign & Title transfer completed
After SPV registration is complete, the listing initiator and investors will sign digital agreements on the Realbit platform:
1) Realbit platform generates the title transfer contract for listing initiator and investors.
2) Listing initiator accepts and signs the title transfer contract.
3) Investors accept and sign the title transfer contract.
4) Registry service provider helps to complete the offline title transfer.
5) Token funds will be transferred from the escrow account to the listing initiator’s wallet.
6) All the title transferring information and trading data are recorded on the blockchain.
When the ownership transfer is completed then the SPV will legally have ownership of the asset and future interactions will be governed by the smart contract system.
## 3.4 Trading
When the underwriting process is complete, asset tokens will be available for trading on the Realbit Exchange Platform. Worldwide investors can easily search and review the asset offerings through the user friendly interface. KYC verified investors can trade asset tokens on the Realbit Exchange Platform with low transaction fees, in a manner similar to a stock exchange.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Trading%20on%20Realbit%20exchange.png)
Tokens or fiat currency can be accepted for investments on the Realbit platform. Tokens include RAB tokens, asset tokens, cryptocurrency (e.g. BTC, ETH...) and there will be an exchange rate among various tokens. Fiat currency can only be accepted in the OTC market (Over-the-Counter Market) on the Realbit platform.
In the process of transaction, Realbit platform will involve a mechanism to dynamically calculate the real-time price of each token according to the current bidding price, number of shares, market environment, etc. When the bid price set by the token buyer is accepted the tokens or fiat currency will be transferred to the seller’s account and the investors acquire the asset tokens, or vice versa.
All the transactions and data are open to users on corresponding side chains to guarantee the transparency of the system.
## 4 Realbit technology framework and features
In terms of technology, we trust that blockchain is one of the most secure technologies for digital asset transfer due to its distributed nature and use of sophisticated cryptography. Smart contracts, therefore, offer a highly attractive solution for the management of illiquid asset transactions via the distributed ledger. At the same time, tokenization creates benefits for asset owners, investors and token holders, thereby aligning user incentives for further growth of the entire network.
Realbit consists of multiple core components in architecture, the following sections offer more detailed descriptions of our key components and core algorithm.
### 4.1 Logical Framework
Realbit has designed an ecosystem powered by blockchain based on EOS technology with the potential for 1,000,000 transactions per second, no transactions fees, smart contracts, incentive mechanisms, inspection, legal, escrow, payments industries, and further innovations.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/State-of-our%20framework.png)
### 4.2 IPFS storage
We will use state of the art blockchain-based mechanisms powerful enough to store terabytes of data and run high performance operations such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of documents.
To encrypt and store digital content onto the blockchain, most blockchain-based storage systems use an encoded ID to reference centrally-hosted data, but the limited storage makes it hard to store extensive strings of metadata onto the blockchain per transaction. If the blockchain and related data expands, it leads to insufficient hash power in the network. The larger the distributed ledger, the more hash power that is needed to maintain the data. So there are technological disadvantages of encoding metadata onto the blockchain.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Custom-built%20distributed%20ledger.png)
Realbit has started a metadata protocol based on blockchain technology that uses IPFS (Interplanetary File System), which eliminates the limitations of existing solutions by using IPFS to store data, record the data onto the blockchain to authenticate the information with the hash of the file content. To store files, Realbit supplies distributed storage with which method the cost of storage space and bandwidth will be extremely reduced compared to the decentralized way. This enables asset trading participants to encrypt to their files such as title deed, digital signature and all the other related documents by making information and documents interoperable and discoverable through a decentralized hybrid system [13].
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Metadata%20protocol%20stack.png)
Complex relations between objects can be expressed with Merkle DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in object content, allowing the application layer to evolve. Realbit uses a coordination layer to discover, merge, and connect multiple DAGs generated by independent individuals into a single, collaborative DAG [14].
In P2P networks, a Merkle Tree is used to ensure that data blocks received from other nodes are not corrupted and not replaced, and check that other nodes do not cheat or publish bogus blocks.
To understand how Merkle DAGs<sup>[13]</sup> address content, see the chart below.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Address%20content%20based%20on%20Merkle%20DAGs.png)
The familiar bittorrent protocol uses P2P technology to enable data transfer between clients, which can speed up the download speed of data and reduce the burden on downloading servers. Before downloading a file from a P2P network, in most cases the top hash is acquired from a trusted source, for instance a friend or a web site that is known to have good recommendations of files to download. When the top hash is available, the hash tree can be received from any non-trusted source, like any peer in the P2P network. Then, the received hash tree is checked against the trusted top hash, and if the hash tree is damaged or fake, another hash tree from another source will be tried until the program finds one that matches the top hash [16].
### 4.3 4.3	Consensus Algorithm (DPOS) 
Realbit is designed to put safety, stability and high-performance as top priorities in order to create the planned ecosystem.
In cryptocurrency technology, the consensus algorithm is used to ensure the whole blockchain network is safe and stable. The most famous consensus algorithms include Bitcoin using PoW (Proof of Work, at 7 TPS in average) and Ethereum planning to introduce a hybrid PoW/PoS (Proof of Stake, at 30 TPS on average). However, none of these consensus algorithms can solve the transaction performance problem, especially the PoW algorithm, which consumes massive amount of power to confirm blocks. DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake, which is being used by EOS) has solved the problem of performance and energy consumption and has proven to be robust, secure, and efficient through reliable operation on multiple blockchains [17]. This is one of the key we have chosen EOS as our main chain solution.
Here, we invoke EOS's description of the DPOS mechanism to clearly understand how it works.
Under DPos algorithm, those who hold tokens on a blockchain may select block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may be chosen to participate in block production. Exactly one producer is authorized to produce a block at any given point in time.
At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The selected producers are shuffled using a pseudorandom number derived from the block time and agreed upon by the producers. This shuffling is done to ensure that all producers maintain balanced connectivity to all other producers.
If the block is not produced at the scheduled time then the block for that time slot is skipped. If a producer misses a block and has not produced any block within the last 24 hours they are removed from consideration until they notify the blockchain of their intention to start producing blocks again.
This ensures the network operates smoothly by minimizing the number of blocks missed by not scheduling those who are proven to be unreliable.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/DPOS%20mechanism.png)
Typical DPOS blockchains have 100% block producer participation. A transaction can be considered confirmed with 99.9% certainty after an average of 1.5 seconds from time of broadcast.
The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second and eliminates usage fees.
### 4.4 Atomic swaps
Atomic swaps, or atomic cross-chain swap, is a distributed coordination task where multiple parties exchange assets across multiple blockchains, for example, trading BTC for RAB, instead of on a centralized exchange. For example, to prevent one side falling to send over his token, atomic swaps utilizes what is known as hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs). HTLCs ensure that the atomic swap process is completely trustless by ensuring both fulfill the requirements of the trade. HTLCs require the recipient of a payment to acknowledge receiving payment prior to a deadline by generating a cryptographic proof of payment. Or the recipient risks losing the right to the claim the payment, therefore returning the funds back to the sender. This results in both transactions being linked to one another, despite them taking place across two different blockchains.
An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol.
A cross-chain swap has an associated directed graph D = (V,A). For any pair (D,L), where D = (V,A) is a strongly-connected directed graph and L⊂V a feedback vertex set for D, we give an atomic cross- chain swap protocol using hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in L generate the hashlocked secrets. [18] [19]
### 4.5 Security
Blockchains rely on encryption to validate transactions by verifying the identities of parties involved in a transaction. This ensures that a faulty or invalid transaction cannot be added to the blockchain without the consent of the parties involved. A complex mathematical calculation known as a hash function is performed each time a transaction is added to the blockchain, which depends on the transaction data, the identities of the parties involved in the transaction, and the result of previous transactions. The fact that the current state of the blockchain depends on previous transactions ensures that a malicious actor cannot alter past transactions. This is because if previous transaction data is changed, it will impact the current value of the hash and not match other copies of the ledger.
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/Data%20structure%20of%20blockchain.png)
On the Realbit platform, we encrypt a key pair, which are used to create transactions. A key pair consists of a private key associated with the owner's address and a unique public key produced by the private key. The public key is used to receive the token, and the private key is to produce cryptographic signature in the transactions.
All submissions can be verified by the public key and signature submitted, and confirm whether the transaction is valid or not, that is, confirming that the payer has the right of ownership of the transaction at this time. The processes are secured by an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) on the curve secp256k1.
### 4.6 Scalability
REALBIT is expected to support BaaS (Blockchain as a service) API which provides inspection services, transaction services, and data services to enable easy access to Realbit data for third- party applications. An API library is being developed.
### 4.7 Smart Contract
Realbit’s architecture consists of multiple contracts, each contract is responsible for a single type of microservice and each contract contains functions that manage the creation and modification of data.
The following participants need to be involved in smart contracts
• Buyer/Investor/Token holder
• Seller (Property owner/Real estate developer/Land owner/Operator)
• Notary or Government validator
• Assessment firm
• Real Inspector
• Law firm
• Escrow
• Recording office/Title registry
• Others
The listing smart contract is responsible for recording the asset’s metadata on the blockchain and RABs will be sent to inspectors (i.e. real estate inspector, title registry, recording office) as compensation.
The tokenization smart contract is responsible for setting listing structures (such as whole property sales, equity split sales, debt split sales, leasing, operation income sharing, etc) and covenant clauses (such as buying back, short term title transfer, long term title transfer, dividend, rental).
The underwriting smart contract is responsible for rating, setting initial prices, bidding, calculating opening price, book keeping, setting up SPV, signing digital deed, title transferring, etc.
### 4.8 Enablement by AI and big data
We expect to implement features of AI and big data in future versions of the Realbit Exchange Platform, helping to rate assets with increased accuracy and efficient in order to minimize risk. Anti-fraud and modeling algorithms will be provided on the Realbit blockchain through deep learning and AI risk control systems.
Through facial recognition technology, users can comply with the KYC (Know Your Customer) policies of Realbit.
AI and big data functionality is under development.
## 5 ProductPrototype
Realbit aims to build the ecosystem that creates asset-backed tokenization and improves the trading efficiency. On the platform, asset tokens can be managed, exchanged, and stored. At this initial phase of the product roadmap, we have developed prototype demonstrations of the Realbit Exchange Platform, asset browser page, and the Realbit wallet.
### 5.1 Asset browser page
Assets listed on Realbit platform can be displayed on asset browser page. On this page, investors can view detailed asset information. Bidding, purchasing, or selling function will also be provided depending on different stages of asset tokens. The following prototype shows the asset browser page.
### 5.2 Realbit exchange platform
Successfully sold tokens in the underwriting process will be displayed and traded on the platform. Realbit Exchange will provide a variety of functions such as search, display, purchase and sell asset tokens.
### 5.3 Realbit wallet
The mobile app and the desktop application will be developed, and there will be a digital wallet to store tokens. With the help of the wallet, users can conveniently manage their asset tokens and RAB tokens in one place and securely sign all transactions. The transaction records are recorded on the ledger of Realbit.
## 6 Platform token(RAB)
Realbit is an autonomous community bound together with economic incentives and opportunities. The RAB token is a utility token. It functions as the medium of exchange and can be used within the Realbit network to incentivize all participants to contribute to the success of the community. It can be used to support various scenarios and do the following:
• Reward for community contributors
The community will attract a variety of participants, such as developers. They will help to build the basic infrastructure and promote the improvement of the community to earn RAB.
• Incentive for asset providers
In order to promote the rapid development and success of the ecosystem, Realbit encourages participants such as listing initiators to use the platform. Initially, the Realbit platform won’t require transaction fees, normally paid with RAB.
• Payment for third party service fees
Third parties (title office, escrow agent, law firms, broker, accounting firms, rating/assessment firms, etc.) will be attracted to provide services. Asset listing initiators or investors will pay for the corresponding fees.
• Payment for transaction fees
As investors trade various asset tokens on Realbit exchange platform there will be small transaction fees to be paid in RAB.
• Purchase of asset tokens or assets on Realbit platform
Investors will purchase various asset tokens with RAB on Realbit platform. There will be a dynamic exchange rate between RAB and other asset tokens.
The above scenarios can be summarized in the following diagram:
![](https://github.com/realbitio/Documentation/blob/master/images/RAB%20earning%20and%20spending.png)
With the participation of more Realbit users and the development of community, the ecosystem will grow to the benefit of all participants. Through this growth, RAB liquidity will increase along with transaction and listing volume.
## 7 Governance
In addition to payment or investment function, the RAB token plays an important role in the governance of Realbit ecosystem. The RAB holders have decentralized governance over the protocols, allowing for voting to decide on future direction.
The voting mechanism is important for the long-term stability of Realbit system. For example, RAB relies on a set of system parameters to function. While some of the parameters can be adjusted automatically, others need opinions from the community with voting. Fixing bugs, proposing and deploying new DApps also needs support from the wider community.
Realbit supports voting mechanisms. Every RAB owner, weighted by their RAB capacity, can participate in the decision-making process of Realbit’s development. In the voting system, users can set their own delegates, and delegates can also set their own delegates. Taking into account a proposal’s technicality and incentives, different proposals can have different acceptance criteria, such as participation rate and support ratio.
Note that RAB’s voting is a tool to express community consensus, not one to form consensus. Before the any voting events, the community should use various communication channels to study the proposals in detail and form a rough consensus.
## 8 Roadmap
In the past 10 years, we have been dedicated to researching the development of real estate market. We find real estate is the largest class of assets and the main problem is illiquidity. The emergence of blockchain technology provides the possibility to improve liquidity. We have an ambitious execution plan and roadmap that started in 2017 Q4. We share with you this glimpse of our plans and we believe we are moving forward swiftly. However, as implementation progresses, the roadmap may be adjusted as needed.
